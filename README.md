TF-IDF-variants-MAP-REDUCE-On-Java
===================================

Stage-1
--------
- TFIDF for all terms in each document, sorted alphabetically by wordsâ€™ letters, and formatted for easy readability.
- List of top fifteen words from each document having the highest TFIDF value.

Stage-2
--------
- Modified the programs to remove from consideration all those words that occur only once in each document. Repeated the tasks of Stage-1 above

Observations on the variation between Stage 1 and Stage 2:
-------------------------------------------------------------
- We observe the words with more relevance across the corpus appear in the top 15 .
- The effect of the words that just appear once in a word and once in a document or very few
documents is high on the TF IDF value on the whole as the denominator depends on it.
- Ignoring such words effects the value as follows:

|Word Frequency|Document Frequency|Number of Documents that word appears in| TF -VALUE | IDF - VALUE|
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
|Only with frequency greater than 1.|Considers only those words that occur more than once. So,decreased|Considers those documents that has this word more than once. So, decreased.| Increases as the denominator decreases as we are eliminating the words that are not very frequent in the document| Increases as the denominator decreases because we are considering only the documents that have the word more than once.|
